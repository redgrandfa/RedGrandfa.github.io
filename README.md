# About me, beyond software
I have explored many interests:

fire staff spinning, 
[acting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bwy9rQ6tusmXfLpL0R30lDwbj4m3Gv-e/view?usp=drive_link), 
[origami](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_e04aC_YPPEhhSFnIHXKWcmz4O656Wgg?usp=drive_link),
[Go](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15q12S1vV9KNg8uVRdXABiaBtyfTwAkwG/view?usp=drive_link),
[Design](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U9IurrF0aCdTK-oYog5H6IBdUfRalTUb?usp=drive_link), 
Guzheng, 
[Erhu](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sUCGbYHCuxEbKwKSG15_mfXMmCWvR2S6/view?usp=drive_link), 
singing, dancing, softball, badminton...

Over time, I realized it wasn’t the activities themselves that interest me—it was the joy of learning and mastering new skills.

With that understanding, I’ve stopped doing them and decide to focus on skills with business value or those in high demand in the job market.

For example, I am willing to [teach Mandarin](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q_sKjO6Jxbzx1ACShD9yIg2r2en9v7b1) because it sharpens my English speaking skills.
