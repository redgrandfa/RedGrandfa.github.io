# Freelance Projects:
## Web: Commission Calculation System for KGI Futures  
- Rewrite & Modernization  
- 2025/02/10 – 2025/05/09  
- ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8) | Dapper | SQL Server | Azure DevOps

### Overview
The legacy website was written in VB, designed for branch offices to upload monthly files and trigger a series of C# WinForm programs step by step to process the data.  
The client requested a complete system rewrite using ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8), implementing a three-tier architecture while ensuring that the new system strictly mirrors the original business logic.

### My Contribution
1. Designed structured prompt templates for LLM-assisted migration, allowing for efficient copy-paste legacy code segments. This approach enabled me to complete the assigned workload using only 70% of the estimated time.
2. Despite the repetitive work of copy-edit-review tasks, I actively identified and extracted redundant logic into shared logic to reduce future technical debt.

## Web: Religious Affairs Management System (Baoguang Chongzheng)
- Rebuild 
- 2023/07 – Present  
- Vercel | Next.js | React.js | Ant Design | Prisma | MySQL | Aiven

### Overview
This platform is developed for the Baoguang Chongzheng branch of the I-Kuan Tao(一貫道) religion. It includes temple, believer, clergy and course modules and course sign up and check-in.  
Due to limitations in the legacy system, we started a full rebuild. The team includes members from Indonesia and Taiwan. The system requires fine-grained access control across hierarchical administrative levels and supports both English and Traditional Chinese.

### My Contribution
- Implemented automated generation of course PDFs using `react-pdf`, including class schedules and attendance sheets, with special formatting needs such as lunar/Gregorian date conversion, Chinese uppercase numerals, and vertical layout.
- Built interactive address components with verified links to Google Maps.
- Facilitated communication among team members from different countries.
- Help new members onboard.

# About me, beyond software
I have explored many interests:

fire staff spinning, 
[acting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bwy9rQ6tusmXfLpL0R30lDwbj4m3Gv-e/view?usp=drive_link), 
[origami](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_e04aC_YPPEhhSFnIHXKWcmz4O656Wgg?usp=drive_link),
[Go](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15q12S1vV9KNg8uVRdXABiaBtyfTwAkwG/view?usp=drive_link),
[Design](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U9IurrF0aCdTK-oYog5H6IBdUfRalTUb?usp=drive_link), 
Guzheng, 
[Erhu](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sUCGbYHCuxEbKwKSG15_mfXMmCWvR2S6/view?usp=drive_link), 
singing, dancing, softball, badminton...

Over time, I realized it wasn’t the activities themselves that interest me—it was the joy of learning and mastering new skills.

With that understanding, I’ve stopped doing them and decide to focus on skills with business value or those in high demand in the job market.

For example, I am willing to [teach Mandarin](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q_sKjO6Jxbzx1ACShD9yIg2r2en9v7b1) because it sharpens my English speaking skills.
